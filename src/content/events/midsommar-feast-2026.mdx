Midsommar — the Swedish celebration of the summer solstice — is one of the most cherished occasions in Scandinavian culture. At The Nordic Deli, we are bringing this beloved tradition to Hope Island with a long-table feast that captures everything wonderful about the Nordic summer: abundance, warmth, community, and the simple joy of gathering around beautiful food.

Our Midsommar feast will take you on a culinary journey through classic Swedish and Nordic flavours. Think house-cured gravlax with dill crème fraîche, new potato salad with chives and mustard vinaigrette, slow-roasted lamb with lingonberry jus, freshly baked rye bread, and traditional elderflower drinks to toast the longest day of the year. We will close the evening with a traditional Swedish midsommar cake — a layered cream and berry celebration finished with the season's freshest strawberries.

Seats are strictly limited to 24 guests to preserve the intimate atmosphere that makes Hygge so special. Drinks packages are available for pre-purchase. This event sells out every year — we encourage you to secure your place early. Please contact us to let us know of any dietary requirements so we can ensure every guest is well looked after.
