The kanelsnurre — the Norwegian twisted cinnamon scroll — is one of the most beloved pastries in all of Scandinavia. Unlike its flatter cousins, the kanelsnurre is characterised by its dramatic spiral shape, deeply spiced cardamom and cinnamon filling, and its signature pearl sugar topping that caramelises to a perfect crunch in the oven. In this hands-on three-hour masterclass, our head baker will guide you through every stage of the process: from building a pillowy enriched dough to mastering the twisting technique that gives these pastries their signature look.

You will leave with not only the skills to recreate these at home, but also a box of a dozen freshly baked kanelsnurre to share with family and friends. Morning tea is included, featuring a selection of our house-made pastries and freshly brewed Nordic coffee. This class is designed for all skill levels — whether you are a complete beginner or an experienced home baker looking to add something new to your repertoire. Class sizes are kept small (maximum 12 participants) to ensure personal instruction and a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere. Please advise us of any dietary requirements at time of booking.
